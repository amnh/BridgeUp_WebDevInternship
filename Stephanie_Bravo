Today I looked at the source codes of Google, NYTimes, LREI, AMNH, Pinterest, and Facebook. I found that for "bigger" websites such as Facebook and Pinterest, the coding style of the programmers was different from those of AMNH and LREI. The source code for FAcebook and Pinterest was very messy, did not include indentations, and didn't include many comments. On the other hand, the code for AMNH included indentations as well as detailed comments as to why certain things were done.
