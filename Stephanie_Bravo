Today I looked at the source codes of Google, NYTimes, LREI, AMNH, Pinterest, and Facebook. I found that for "bigger" websites such as Facebook and Pinterest, the coding style of the programmers was different from those of AMNH and LREI. The source code for FAcebook and Pinterest was very messy, did not include indentations, and didn't include many comments. On the other hand, the code for AMNH included indentations as well as detailed comments as to why certain things were done. I thought this was a way for future programmers to know why certain things were set up or why certain things were done in case the programmer is not available to answer these questions. I was able to understand some of the basic code- such as links, headers, titles, paragraphs. However, I found that there were a lot of different functions that I didn't know and I didn't know their use/ how to use them.
