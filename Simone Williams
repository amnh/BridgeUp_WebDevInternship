I felt really smart looking through the source code because I understood about half of the code that I was reading.
Websites I looked at included big name ones like Google and Facebook, whose source code was very confusing. Everything
was jumbled together and was uncomprehensible. The smaller name websistes like the ones in the article had very basic layouts and 
coding for their page that was very simple to understand. One thing that popped up frequently that I had no idea what it was
was metadata. From looking at the code on my school's website, I learned that they use a bit of Google analytics code
to track info about the people who visit their page. A lot of other websites apparently use Google analytics to track the info
that people graviatate towards to, how long they stay on the page, etc. The source codes for the websites frequently combine 
the page for javascript and css.
